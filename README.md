Sprint Review and Retrospective - Portfolio Reflection


How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I interpret user needs by first understanding what the customer or end user is trying to achieve, not just what they say they want. Creating user stories helps break those needs down into small, clear goals written from the user’s point of view. 
For example, a story like “As a user, I want to log in securely so that my data is protected” gives both context and purpose. 
From there, I can plan what features, functionality, and tests are needed to meet that need. User stories make development more focused on delivering real value rather than just completing technical tasks.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach development by first planning what needs to be built, then breaking the work into smaller, manageable pieces that can be completed within short sprints. 
I like to get feedback early and often so that changes can be made before too much work is done. In the future, I plan to continue using Agile practices such as sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives. 
These processes keep communication open, help teams stay organized, and make it easier to adapt when requirements change.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means more than just writing code - it’s about collaboration, communication, and accountability. A good developer shares ideas, listens to others, and supports teammates when challenges come up. 
It also means being reliable by completing tasks on time, giving helpful feedback during reviews, and always focusing on the shared goal of delivering quality software to the customer.
